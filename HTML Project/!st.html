    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red jungle <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">fowl</a>, originally from
    <aside>
        <p class="para">This is the aside which will seperate the things</p>
    </aside>
    India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
    Ceylon
    junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<a href="www.google.com"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Rooster and cock are terms for
    adult male birds, and a
    younger male may be
    called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a
    sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
    their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced
    in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

    <p class="para">Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
        billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
        literature.</p>

    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
    Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
    subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in
    the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and
    Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th
    century BC.[7][8]
